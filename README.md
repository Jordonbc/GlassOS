# GlassOS
Glass OS is a Desktop Environment that runs on all operating systems that has python installed. This is a project that i would like to develop with in the coming years and i want to make it accessable to everyone, tech people and non-tech people.

Worried about your current operating system?
Theres no need to worry Glass OS os a dedicated program that just runs in fullscreen on-top of your current operating system and it does not start-up at boot.

## Built-in programs:

### Jpad
Jpad is a text editor much like notepad with all the basic functionality.

### Custom App Launcher (CAL)
Custom App Launcher allows you to run any (windows / mac / Linux / Python) program on your computer through Glass OS.

### File Explorer
File Explorer allows you to view files stored from your computer.

### Music Player (EXPERIMENTAL - May break your Glass OS)
The Music Player allows you to play music files from your computer.

### Settings
The settings program allows you to customise Glass OS with lots of features including a touch-friendly start menu.

### Glass OS Info Panel
This tool allows you to check your version of glass os.

### Check For Updates
This allows you to check for updates (Broken).

### Hardware Monitor
Hardware Monitor allows you to Check your storage, RAM and CPU usage.

### Terminal
This is a cool thing I added. It is an integrated python terminal embedded in Glass OS. It allows you to type python commands.
